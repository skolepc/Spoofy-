## Overview

**Spoofy** is a lightweight, open-source Python 3.10 script FOR WINDOWS 10 that enables developers, security researchers, and students to send SMS messages with **custom sender IDs (spoofed caller IDs)** using **free, publicly accessible SMS gateway APIs** — **while they remain available**.

These APIs are often provided by telecom testing platforms, anonymous messaging services, or temporary gateway providers. They typically allow a limited number of free messages per day or IP before requiring registration or payment. *Spoofy automates the process*, letting you send messages directly from your terminal with minimal setup.
